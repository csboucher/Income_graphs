<h5>Hypothesis: Both 2008 economic crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic both caused a decrease in average income which
    correlates to a larger number of people having income below the poverty line.</h5>

    This data was found and collected from the United States government from census data spanning from 1967 to
    2020. The hypothesis was found to be both correct and incorrect. There are decreases in the average income during
    the 2008 financial crisis but this decrease in income starts in the 2006-2007 year. The Covid-19 pandemic dip in
    average income is seen at the far left end of the graph from the 2019-2020 year.

    The percentage of people below the poverty line shows the 2008 crisis through large jump in poverty from year
    2008 to 2009. The percentage of men in poverty increased by approximately 2% more than the women's during this
    time. The 2020 pandemic didn't cause the same increase in people below the poverty line. Women living below the
    poverty line increased from the years 2019-2020 but not by as large of a jump in 2008. The male unemployment rate
    remained constant. These graphs show that there may not be a one-to-one correlation between the trend of
    average income and the trend of unemployment.</font></p></i>
